mathName:" Algebra",
description:" algebra, branch of mathematics in which arithmetical operations and formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than specific numbers. The notion that there exists such a distinct subdiscipline of mathematics, as well as the term algebra to denote it, resulted from a slow historical development. This article presents that history, tracing the evolution over time of the concept of the equation, number systems, symbols for conveying and manipulating mathematical statements, and the modern abstract structural view of algebra. For information on specific branches of algebra, see elementary algebra, linear algebra, and modern algebra.",

    mathName:" Logic and Set Theor",
    description:" Set theory and mathematical logic are closely related fields in mathematics. Set theory focuses on the study of sets, which are well-defined collections of objects, while mathematical logic explores formal systems of reasoning and proof. Together, they form the foundation for much of modern mathematics. ",

        description:" Geometry (from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría) 'land measurement'; from γῆ (gê) 'earth, land' and μέτρον (métron) 'a measure') is a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. ",

            mathName:" Euclidean Geometry",
            description:" Euclidean geometry is a system of geometry based on a set of axioms and theorems, primarily dealing with flat surfaces and solid shapes. It's known for its simplicity and its application to everyday spatial reasoning. Euclidean geometry is characterized by its use of undefined terms like points, lines, and planes, and its reliance on axioms and postulates to derive theorems. ",
